<!--

This is a sample "user" stylesheet.

In future, we may have IGB load a user stylesheet from the applications directory
at startup; then allow users to modify it through some sort of GUI; then save
it back to the applications data directory at shut-down, similar to the way
the bookmarks.html file is handled.

This "default" user stylesheet could be copied to the applications directory
during initial installation.

But for now, it will simply stay hidden here in the jar and will be used only
to test the proper cascading.  Specifically, the "user" stylesheet may extend 
or override settings in the "system" stylesheet.
