		<h1>Graphs</h1> 
		<p>This panel allows you to change default options for newly-created graphs.  Changes have no effect on existing graphs, but apply to any new graphs created afterwards.  Graph bookmarks can contain information about the properties of each graph.  Properties specified in bookmarks will take precedence over these defaults.</p> 
		<h2>Use floating graphs by default</h2> 
		<p>Whether new graphs should be floating by default.  Has no effect on graphs loaded through bookmarks since they explicitly specify floating or not-floating.  Has no effect on graphs created from '.egr' files.  Recommend: false.</p> 
		<h2>Use file URL as graph name</h2> 
		<p>Whether to use the complete URL for the name of newly-loaded graphs.  True uses the complete URL 'file:///home/graph.gr'; False uses the shorter filename 'graph.gr'.  Has no effect on graphs loaded through bookmarks if they explicitly set a graph name.  Recommend: false.</p> 
		<h2>Make graphs from scored-interval files</h2> 
		<p>When loading data from an '.egr' file (sometimes called a '.sin' file) the program can automatically convert the score or scores into a graph or graphs.  Usually you want this to happen, so set this to true.  Recommend: true.</p> 
		<h2>Preferred Heatmap</h2> 
		<p>Default heatmap to use for graphs created from scored-interval files.  The 'blue/yellow' and 'black/white' maps are good choices in general, but the 'red/black/green' map is preferred for some uses.</p>
