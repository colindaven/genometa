		<h1>Shortcut Keystrokes</h1>
		<p>Use this panel to associate a shortcut keystroke with various menu items and other actions.  Choose an action, type a key combination and press 'Apply'.  It is necessary to shut down and <b>restart</b> the program before the changes take effect.</p>
		<p>Each keystroke must contain at least one modifier key, like 'control' or 'alt'.  It is possible to assign the same shortcut to multiple actions, but that should generally be avoided.</p>
		<p>Shortcut keys for zooming and scrolling the view will apply both in the main view and in the sliced view.  The effect can be confusing when both views are visible in the same window at the same time.  Opening the sliced view in a separate window can give more predictable shortcut behavior.</p>
