<h2>User preference changes</h2>
<h3>The <u>igb_prefs.xml</u> file is being deprecated.</h3>
In versions 3.x, users had to set preferences, such as annotation colors in
a file called <u>igb_prefs.xml</u>.  This file was difficult to edit and did not
allow the changes to be immediately seen.
<br>
<br>
With version 4, the <u>igb_prefs.xml</u> file is almost obsolete.
The majority of users should ignore this file.
(Very advanced users may still find a few uses for it.)
If you are still sometimes using older versions of IGB, you may
choose to keep your <u>igb_prefs.xml</u> file in place.  
Version 4 will simply ignore most of the contents.

<h3>Setting annotation preferences</h3>

When you first load annotation data into IGB, <i>all</i> types of data
will be displayed in the <i>same</i> default color and style.
By default, only "RefSeq" data will display labels.
<br>
<br>
You can change some properties just as before, by right-clicking on
the tier labels and choosing "Hide", "Collapse", "Expand", "Adjust Max Expand",
or "Change Annotation Color".  The main difference now is that these
changes will be persistent.  If you shut down the program and
restart it, these settings will remain.  (Except that hidden tiers
will become visible again when you restart and reload that data.)
<br>
<br>

To access more advanced features, right-click on the tier labels and
choose "Customize".  Alternatively, you can access the same customization
panel by choosing the "File-&gt;Preferences" menu.
<br>
<br>

From the tier preferences panel, you can
<ul>
<li>set foreground and background colors,
</li><li>change the displayed tier names
</li><li>combine (+) and (-) tiers into a single (+/-) tier,
</li><li>collapse or expand tiers,
</li><li>change the maximum tier heights,
</li><li>choose to draw data without connecting lines (appropriate for "repeats" and "contigs"),
</li><li>choose to display labels.
</li></ul>
You may also change the <i>default</i> values of most of these properties.
(A few of the default values are protected from changes.)
For more details, use the "Help" menu on the preferences panel.
Changes take effect as soon as you close this window.
<br>
<br>

Regardless of whether you set properties from the preferences panel
or by right-clicking a tier, the properties will persist between sessions.
Settings for temporarily-created tiers, such as from the union of two
tiers, do not persist between sessions.
<br>
<br>

One other change to note: forward and reverse strands of the same annotation
type now must have matching colors and styles.  Changing one strand automatically
changes the other as well.  (We may later revise this to allow strands to
be hidden independently.)


<h2>Remaining features of <u>igb_prefs.xml</u></h2>

Advanced users may still choose to specify the location of a QuickLoad server
in <u>igb_prefs.xml</u>, or to specify URL's that can be used 
by the "Get More Info" hyperlinks.

<p>
Here is an example of how to set the QuickLoad URL, 
and how to add a hyperlink.
</p>

<code>
&lt;tagval tag="QuickLoadUrl" val="http://netaffxdas.affymetrix.com/quickload_data/"/&gt;
<br>
&lt;annotation_url annot_type_regex="EnsGene"
    url="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/textview?idx=All&amp;q=$$" /&gt;
</code>

<p>
In version 4.02 the URL set this way in the "igb_prefs.xml" file 
will replace the standard NetAffx QuickLoad URL.  (Due to a bug,
any server set with the "Options" button in the QuickLoad panel will
be ignored.)
</p>
<p>
In version 4.10 and higher, you are allowed to have multiple QuickLoad servers.
You will always have access to the NetAffx QuickLoad server,
and you may add an optional "Personal" server using the 
"Options" button in the QuickLoad panel.  To maintain
compatibility with earlier versions, if a QuickLoad URL 
is also set in the "igb_prefs.xml" file, it will become a third,
"Auxiliary" QuickLoad server.
</p>

<h2>DAS/2 servers</h2>

Beginning with version 4.02, there is support for loading data from DAS/2 servers.
<br>
<br>
Earlier versions already had support for loading data from DAS servers.
However, there is a new form of DAS server, DAS version 2.0, that is under development.
Refer to http://biodas.org/ for more information on the DAS/2 specification.
<br>
<br>
Two experimental DAS/2 servers are available now.  Feel free to test them, but
be aware of their experimental nature.  Until the DAS/2 specification becomes
stable, you will generally need the most recent version of IGB to use these
experimental servers.


<h2>DAS/1 servers</h2>
You may continue to access DAS/1 servers as before, using
"File-&gt;Load DAS Features".  
<br>
<br>
If no DAS/1 servers are listed when you try that,
or if you wish to add additional servers,
you may add servers with "File-&gt;Preferences" in the "DAS Servers" panel.
These two servers are a good place to start: 
"http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/das/" and 
"http://netaffxdas.affymetrix.com/das/"


<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

There are various smaller enhancements and bug fixes, including:
<ul>
<li>enhancements and fixes in the "Pivot View"
</li><li>curations have been disabled, but will return in improved form in a future release
</li><li>the Graph Adjuster tab has been simplified somewhat
</li><li>problems with "right-clicking" graphs on Macintosh have been resolved
</li></ul>

<h2>Known Bugs in Version 4.02</h2>

Unfortunately, a few bugs were introduced with release 4.02.
These bugs were fixed in version 4.10.

<p>
<b>QuickLoad server:</b>  The graphical interface for setting the location
of the QuickLoad server <b>does not work</b> in version 4.02.  
If you need to use a server other than the default one, 
you will need to edit your "igb_prefs.xml" file.
</p>
<p>
For example on Linux:<br>
<code>
&lt;tagval tag="QuickLoadUrl" val="file:///home/steve/quickload/" /&gt;
</code>
<br>
or on Windows:
<br>
<code>
&lt;tagval tag="QuickLoadUrl" val="file:///c:/Documents and Settings/name/quickload/" /&gt;
</code>
</p>

<p>
<b>Tier Labels:</b>
If you change the tier label display name through the tier preferences panel,
the name may not take effect until you re-start the program.  Likewise,
if you change from displaying forward and reverse strands separately to displaying them
together, the label may not update to reflect this change, although the data
will be drawn in one or two tiers as you requested.
