      This demo exercises many of the methods in the NeoMapI API.
      The <a href="src/genoviz/demo/NeoMapDemo.java">source</a>
      is considerably longer than most of the tutorials.  However,
      notice that most of this code is in adding lots of menus and
      tying those menus to NeoMapI API calls.  The part that sets up
      the map as it initially appears is still fairly small.  For more
      details on the API calls this applet demonstrates, take a look
      at the JavaDocs for <a
      href="../docs/com/affymetrix/genoviz/widget/NeoMap.html"> NeoMap
      </a> and <a
      href="../docs/com/affymetrix/genoviz/widget/NeoWidget.html">
      NeoWidget</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One important point which is not so obvious in the source code
      is what gets taken care of automatically by the NeoMap.  For
      example, consider the coordination of zooming and scrolling.
      When the applet runs, two windows should be brought up, one that
      contains the map and scrollbars for scrolling the map, and
      another window with two other scrollbars for scaling/zooming the
      map (actually these are all JScrollBars).  We put the zoom
      controls in a separate window to emphasize that these controls
      are not part of the map widget itself, but can easily be
      registered as map widget controls.  In the source code this is
      straightforward:
    </p>

    <pre>
xzoomer = new JScrollBar(JScrollBar.HORIZONTAL);
yzoomer = new JScrollBar(JScrollBar.HORIZONTAL);
map.setZoomer(map.X, xzoomer);
map.setZoomer(map.Y, yzoomer);
    </pre>
    

    <p>
      After setting up a map this way, user interaction with the
      xzoomer or yzoomer scrollbars will change the scale of the map.
      You can also control the scale of a map via API calls like:
    </p>

<pre>
map.zoom(map.X, 2)  
</pre>

    <p>
      which will scale the map to 2 pixels/base (assuming this is a
      DNA-based map).  The NeoMap will automatically propagate this
      change to the xzoomer scrollbar.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not obvious where to put controls for scaling a map.  In
      contrast, most people are used to the metaphor of a scrollbar
      attached to a panel which scrolls the contents of the window.
      Therefore support for automatically attaching scroll bars to the
      map is included in the NeoMap.  In fact if you look at the demo
      source code you'll see there's no explicit mention of the
      scrollbars for scrolling.  If you want more control over NeoMap
      scrolling you can use a NeoMap constructor that takes booleans
      for whether to automatically attach horizontal and vertical
      scrollers.  If internal scrollers are turned off, external
      scrollers can be added much like zoomers:
    </p>

    <pre>
map = new NeoMap(true, false);  // turn off internal vertical scroller
yscroller = new JScrollBar(JScrollBar.VERTICAL);
map.setScroller(map.Y, yscroller);
</pre>

    <p>
      In either case (external or internal scrollers), API calls like:
    </p>

<pre>
map.scroll(map.X, 50) 
</pre>

    <p>
      automatically propagate changes to the scrollers.  And user
      interaction with the zoomer scrollbars or API calls to
      map.zoom(orientation, scale) also automatically propagate
      appropriate changes to the scrollbar, modifying the size and
      position of the scroll thumb.
    </p>

      To reiterate, for more details on the many API calls this applet
      demonstrates take a look at the JavaDocs for <a
      href="../docs/com/affymetrix/genoviz/widget/NeoMap.html">NeoMap</a>
      and <a
