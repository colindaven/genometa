This demo shows how one widget can be "shadowed" on another.
The two widgets have been set up
so the range of sequence shown in the NeoSeq (left) is represented
in the NeoMap (framed in right)
by a red shadow along the axis.
Any changes in this range are propagated to the shadow.
So as you scroll the NeoSeq,
you can watch the red outline move along the axis
of the NeoMap.
