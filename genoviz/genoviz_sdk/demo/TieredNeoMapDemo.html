    This demo shows some of the capabilities of a TieredNeoMap, which 
    extends NeoMap. &nbsp; TieredNeoMaps are useful in a case where there
    are several classes of data that need to be displayed, but it is not
    predetermined how much area is going to be consumed by each type of
    data.  &nbsp; Each type of data is allocated to a tier (implemented by a
    <a href="../docs/com/affymetrix/genoviz/widget/tieredmap/MapTierGlyph.html"> MapTierGlyph</a>). &nbsp; The state of each tier, implemented by different packers, can
    be EXPANDED, COLLAPSED, or HIDDEN, or FIXED_SIZE. &nbsp; Only the first three
    are shown in this demo, and the tiers start out EXPANDED.  

    <p>
    Click on a
    tier to add more glyphs to it, and notice how the tier expands as
    necessary, making enough room for all the data added to the map, and yet
    keeping glyphs representing different categories of data separate. &nbsp; To view
    the other states, right click (or ctrl-click) on the label to the right of each tier, and 
    choose a state. &nbsp; Shift-clicking on a glyph removes it, and the tier collapses to a smaller size.
    &nbsp; In order to restore tiers that have been hidden, choose
    File-&gt;Show All Tiers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Those labels to the right of the TieredNeoMap are implemented as  a 
    TieredLabelMap. &nbsp; The TieredLabelMap automatically generates labelling tiers
    as new Tiers are added to the main map. &nbsp; TieredLabelMap is a subclass of
    TieredNeoMap and stays in sync with the TieredNeoMap by registering as a listener
    for changes to the map it is labelling.
