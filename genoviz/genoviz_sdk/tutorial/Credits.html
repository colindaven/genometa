<h1>History</h1>
<p>The original Genoviz SDK first appeared as the 
Neomorphic Genome Software Development Kit, a commercial version of the 
BioViews toolkit Dr. Gregg Helt developed as part of his Ph.D. thesis 
in Gerry Rubin's lab at U.C. Berkeley.  
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9521932?dopt=AbstractPlus">Article describing BioViews</a>)
<p>In 1998, Gregg Helt and fellow Berkeley graduate students Martin Reese 
and Cyrus Harmon formed Neomorphic Software, which further developed 
the BioViews code, renaming it the Neomorphic Genome Software Development Kit. 
Early NGSDK customers included Celera Genomics, 
biotechnology company MendelBio, Genentech, and others. 
When Affymetrix bought Neomorphic in 2000, Helt and colleagues continued 
to develop the code, ultimately releasing it as open source software in 2004.
<p>Many of the package and class names reflect this history; 
we continue to use these names to acknowledge the software's early supporters.
