<h1>        Data Adapters
</h1>
<p>        Adding items directly to the map
        or through the map's factories
        by specifying a start and end position
        works for simple annotations.
        For more complex annotations,
        classes
        that implement the
        interface
        NeoDataAdapterI
        provide a more general mechanism
        to represent data models on the map.
        However, making a data adapter class requires knowledge
        of both the data model one wants to represent
        and more of the internals of the map widget.
</p>
<p>        Data Adapters can be used
        to automate building a visual representation
        of datamodels.
        Each data adapter is specific
        to a particular class of data model.
        Once a data adapter has been constructed
        and added to the map,
        calling Map.addData(model) will represent the model
        in the map
        in a manner specific to the data adapter
        and its configuration.
</p>
<p>        A <a href="../demo/src/genoviz/demo/datamodel/ScoredAnnotation.java"
        >ScoredAnnotation</a> models a scored annotation.
        It extends an <a href="../demo/src/genoviz/demo/datamodel/Annotation.java">Annotation</a>.
        It can be constructed
        by giving it a start, an end, and a score
        between 0 and 1 inclusive.
</p>
<p>        A <a href="../demo/src/genoviz/demo/adapter/ScoredAnnotAdapter.java"
        >ScoredAnnotAdapter</a> uses the score
        of an annotation
        to determine a grayscale value
        to color the glyph representing it.
        Unless told otherwise,
        it assumes a scoring system
        that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0,
        and maps this along a linear color scale,
        from 0.0 = black to 1.0 = white.
        Values outside this range will give unpredictable results.

<li>        Add syntax to our SimpleMap program
        to allow a user
        to specify a scored annotation.
        Use <a href="../demo/src/genoviz/demo/NeoMapDemo.java"
        >NeoMapDemo</a> as an example to help guide you.
