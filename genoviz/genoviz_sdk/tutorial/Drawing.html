<h1>        Drawing
</h1>
<p>        Just for fun
        (and because I'm told
        every tutorial should have a drawing program)
        here is a simple drawing program.
        It is more interesting as an application.
        There you have menus
        for selecting different types of glyphs
        to draw
        and different colors
        to draw them with.
        Notice how the packer behaves
        as you draw glyphs.
        Just point, grunt, and drag.

<p>        Look at the <a href="../demo/src/genoviz/tutorial/NeoDraw.java">source</a>
        to see another use for handling events.

<h2>         Exercises
</h2>
<ol>
<li>        Like an Etch-A-Sketch
        NeoDraw will not save files.
        Add this feature.
</li>
<li>        Add a selection mode
        to the Glyph menu.
        Then add a Delete command
        to the Edit menu
        to delete the selected Glyph.
</ol>
