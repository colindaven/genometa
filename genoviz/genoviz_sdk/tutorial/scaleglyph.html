<h1>        Semantic Zooming

</h1>
<p>        To take the glyph example a little bit further, you
        can easily include functionality to display
        amounts of information depending on the size that the 
        glyph is rendered.
<p>        Here is the <a href="../demo/src/genoviz/tutorial/ScaleText.java">source</a> for an example that will display a text String to 
        fit inside the bounding area of its glyph.

<p>


<div class="applet">
<applet
    codebase="../demo"
    archive="genoviz.jar"
        code="genoviz.tutorial.TutorialGlyphDemo2"
        height="150"
        width="570"
>
</applet>
</div class="applet">

<p>        The code for the applet shown which uses ScaleText is identical to the
        previous example except that it creates glyphs of type ScaleText 
        rather than RoundRect.

<h2>         Exercises
</h2>
<ol>
<li>        Write a new text glyph that will crop a text string to fit within
        the glyph and keep the font size fixed.
           
</li>
<li>    In this example new fonts are created when the text is scaled, though often
        they are created for sizes that may have been created previously.  Change the 
        ScaleText glyph to allow it to cache commonly used font sizes.
</li>
</ol>
