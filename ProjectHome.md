## Introduction ##

Genometa is a Java based local bioinformatics program which allows rapid analysis of metagenomic short read datasets. Millions of short reads can be accurately analysed within minutes and visualised in the browser component. A large database of diverse bacteria and archaea has been constructed as a reference sequence.

Our approach is based upon the established open source visualisation tool IGB (http://bioviz.org/igb/) and supported by the rapid alignment program bowtie (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/). We also make use of the excellent open source Picard toolset for SAM (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) files. Genometa is thus also an open source project with full source code available from the Downloads page.
